#Ahello REST API documentation

#На данной странице вы можете выполнять запросы к API, для этого необходимо указать 'appId', который  был передан вам сотрудниками тех. поддержки в поле api_key. Укажите также PartnerUserId (это CRM Id пользователя или его email ), partnerUserId передается в заголовке запроса. Важно!!! ApiKeys-аутентификация c указанием только ключа appId в ближайшее время будет работать только для данной страницы документации. Для реальных сценариев интеграции необходимо использовать HMAC-аутентификацию. В ближайшее время появится раздел помощи по основным вопросам работы с API
